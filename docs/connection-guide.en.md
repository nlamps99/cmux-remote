cmux Remote has two parts:

- **Mac**: `cmux-relay` (a small background service) runs next to cmux and
  answers the iPhone's requests.
- **iPhone**: the cmux Remote app attaches only to that relay, over Tailscale.

For the iPhone to connect, three things must be true at once:
**① cmux running + ② relay running + ③ same Tailnet**. When it won't
connect, one of these three is almost always missing.

---

## 0. Prerequisites (once)

```bash
cmux --version       # cmux must be installed and running
tailscale status     # Tailscale must be signed in and online
swift --version      # Swift 5.10+ (Xcode 15.3+)
```

- No `cmux`? → install and launch [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) first.
- No `tailscale`? → install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on **both** Mac and iPhone, signed into the same account.
- No `swift`? → install Xcode from the App Store (or `xcode-select --install`).

---

## 1. Install (on the Mac)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewTurn2017/cmux-remote.git
cd cmux-remote
./scripts/install-launchd.sh
```

That one line:

1. builds the relay in release mode (`~/.cmuxremote/bin/`),
2. writes a default config if none exists (`~/.cmuxremote/relay.json`),
3. registers it as a background service that auto-starts on login.

Logs land in `~/.cmuxremote/log/`.

> The first build can take a few minutes. If you get an error about
> `swift` or `launchctl` not being found, re-check **Prerequisites** above.

---

## 2. Confirm the relay is up (on the Mac)

```bash
curl -s http://$(tailscale ip -4):4399/v1/health
```

`{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.0"}` means the **relay is healthy**.

Confirm it also attached to the cmux socket:

```bash
./scripts/cmux-probe.sh
# {"id":"probe-1","result":{...}}  ← a result object means OK
```

If both are fine, go to step 3 (pairing). If there's no response, jump to
**4. Troubleshooting**.

---

## 3. Pair your iPhone

Find your Mac's address first:

```bash
tailscale ip -4      # e.g. 100.101.102.103  ← enter this in the app
tailscale status     # if you'd rather use the MagicDNS name (e.g. my-mac)
```

On the iPhone, open the cmux Remote app and:

1. Open **Settings**, then tap **+** under **computers**.
2. Enter a name, the Tailscale IP (or full `*.ts.net` DNS name), and port **`4399`**.
3. Tap **Save & Connect**. The relay checks your Tailscale identity against its allowed logins.

Once connected, the workspace list appears.

### Multiple Macs

Repeat the setup on each Mac, then add each one in Settings. Use the computer
menu at the top of the app to switch. The app remembers the selected computer
after restart and keeps a separate Keychain credential for each address and port.
Existing single-Mac settings and matching credentials migrate automatically.

Each computer can use DIRECT, SERVER, or AUTO. AUTO keeps both its LAN and
Broker settings and credentials. The add/edit sheet also accepts the relay's
pairing QR code. Pairing codes are stored separately in Keychain and cleared
for the relevant transport after registration succeeds.

Only one relay is connected at a time. Switching or reconnecting clears the
current workspace, terminal, and Inbox state; notification history is not merged
across computers. Local notification links only open a workspace when their
source matches the selected computer. Remote notifications without a source
identifier open Inbox instead of selecting a workspace.

Use a computer's **...** menu to edit or remove it. **Unpair Current Computer**
clears that computer's local credential while keeping its address for reconnecting.
Removing or unpairing a computer does not clear other computers' credentials or
revoke the registration on the Mac. For server-side revocation, use the relay's
device revocation command.

## 4. Troubleshooting

Check these in order, one line at a time. **Most issues resolve at ① or ②.**

```bash
SERVICE="gui/$(id -u)/com.genie.cmuxremote"
```

### ① Is cmux running?

If the cmux app is closed, the relay can't read the screen.

```bash
cmux --version
# After launching the cmux app:
launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"
```

### ② Is the relay alive?

```bash
curl -s http://$(tailscale ip -4):4399/v1/health
```

- No response → restart: `launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"`
- Still nothing → reinstall: `./scripts/install-launchd.sh`
- Status: `launchctl print "$SERVICE" | grep -E "state|pid|last exit"`

### ③ Are the logs healthy?

```bash
tail -n 40 ~/.cmuxremote/log/stderr.log
```

Healthy startup shows these three lines:

```
starting cmux-relay on 0.0.0.0:4399
listening …
cmux event stream attached
```

Depending on the log:

| Log message | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `cmux event stream unavailable: socketMissing` | cmux is not running | Launch the cmux app, then `launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"` |
| Repeated `Connection refused` | cmux restarted and the socket name rotated | `launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"`; if needed, re-run `./scripts/install-launchd.sh` |
| Repeated `cmux event stream attached` then immediately `detached` | cmux socket access denied (cmux 0.64+) | See **③a** below |
| Three lines OK but only the app can't attach | network/address issue | Check ④ and ⑤ |

### ③a Socket access denied (cmux 0.64+)

cmux 0.64 introduced a socket access control mode that defaults to
`cmuxOnly` — only processes launched inside cmux can connect. The relay
runs as a launchd agent outside cmux and is denied.

Fix: tell cmux to accept password-authenticated external connections by
creating `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json` with:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/cmux
cat > ~/.config/cmux/cmux.json <<EOF
{
  "automation": {
    "socketControlMode": "password",
    "socketPassword": "$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
  }
}
EOF
```

Or write the file manually with any strong password you choose, then
reload from **inside a cmux terminal**:

```bash
cmux reload-config
launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"
```

The relay reads the password once when its process starts, from
`~/.local/state/cmux/socket-control-password` (written by cmux on
reload). Restarting it after the reload makes it pick up the new password.

### ④ Is Tailscale online on both ends?

```bash
tailscale status
```

- The Mac and iPhone must be on the **same Tailnet (same account)**.
- Make sure Tailscale is toggled on in the iPhone's Tailscale app.

### ⑤ Is the address in the app correct?

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

- Confirm the app uses this exact **IP** and port **`4399`**.
- If you used a MagicDNS name, it must match `tailscale status` spelling.

### Still stuck?

A previously paired device token may have been revoked.

```bash
.build/release/cmux-relay devices list     # see registered devices
# If needed, remove a device and re-pair from the app:
# .build/release/cmux-relay devices revoke <device-id>
```

## FAQ

**Q. It disconnects every time I restart cmux.**
cmux can change its internal socket name on restart. The fastest way to
re-attach the relay:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.genie.cmuxremote"
```

**Q. We're on the same Wi-Fi but it won't connect.**
This app connects over **Tailscale**, not Wi-Fi. Both ends must be signed
into Tailscale, and the app needs the IP from `tailscale ip -4`.

**Q. No notifications.**
Notifications are currently *local*: they only arrive while the app is
open or alive in the background. If you fully quit the app, none arrive
(real push is planned for v1.1).

**Q. Do I have to start it manually each time?**
No. The relay is a launchd service, so it **auto-starts on Mac login** and
respawns if it dies. You do, however, need to **launch the cmux app**
yourself.

## Short notice to send to a user

Forward this verbatim to anyone reporting they can't connect:

> **cmux Remote connection check (run on the Mac)**
>
> 1. Make sure the cmux app is open.
> 2. Paste into Terminal:
>    ```bash
>    SERVICE="gui/$(id -u)/com.genie.cmuxremote"
>    launchctl kickstart -k "$SERVICE"
>    curl -s http://$(tailscale ip -4):4399/v1/health
>    ```
>    → `{"ok":true,...}` means the relay is healthy.
> 3. Confirm the iPhone app and the Mac are signed into the **same
>    Tailscale account**.
> 4. In the app, enter the IP from `tailscale ip -4` and port `4399`.
>
> Still stuck? Send the output of
> `tail -n 40 ~/.cmuxremote/log/stderr.log`.
